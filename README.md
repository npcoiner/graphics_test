# graphics_test

This repository contains a minimal WebGPU example that renders many cubes using
instanced rendering. Open `cubes/index.html` in a browser with WebGPU enabled to
run the demo. Use **W/S** to zoom in and out and **A/D** to rotate the scene.
Rendering is throttled to 30&nbsp;fps to reduce GPU load.
